When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use a remote repository when i don't have access to my local work.  It's probably good practice to maintain sync of the
local repo and github at all times.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's preferred to manually pull changes so that you can decide when the changes are pulled, 
become aware of what changes are pulled (in case changes were made by other parties) before you manually pull them, and whether you'd like to pull at all.
